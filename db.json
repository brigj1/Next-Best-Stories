One fine day, when Winnie the Pooh woke up, he realized the day was extremely windy. “I should visit my thinking spot,” decided the fluffy bear. And out of his bed, Winnie flew, quickly gathering his things and marching off to his thinking spot.  “What a blustery day today is,” he chuckled happily."

As little Pooh was busy thinking, Gopher, the beaver suddenly popped out of the ground. “If I were you, I would quickly go back home. It’s Windsday, you know?”"
